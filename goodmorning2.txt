hello

news has a class called recent for the recent news, just a background change, quite subtle depending on your monitor contrast.

have added an about box but not styled, maybe its ok as it is, also depends on what (if anything) is going in there.

have styled the pagination

all topics are in correct colour order

it would be good if the news hover was smoother is that possible? maybe with a quick ease transition?

meta description needs to be filled in

I have updated our team page with my list of resources

Peace! :)
